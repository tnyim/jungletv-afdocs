Boosted AF is a software development contest where everyone is invited to build projects for the JungleTV Application Framework!
Organized by the JungleTV team, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to compete with others at developing applications for the JungleTV AF, while being handsomely rewarded.

**Don't miss out on a prize pool of 100K [Banano](https://banano.cc) and counting!**

> If you've never heard of it, [JungleTV](https://jungletv.live) is a media sharing website for the Banano community, where people gather to consume videos and music together, while spending and receiving Banano.
>
> The JungleTV Application Framework (also known as JungleTV AF or JAF) is a way for anyone to extend the functionality of the service in a relatively simple way, without having to change the JungleTV source code.
In order to make JungleTV AF applications, you don't even have to install any software other than the browser you are already using!
For more information, check out the [introduction](./introduction/README.md) section of this manual.

Boosted AF has no categories or a specific theme - all submissions compete with each other, and applications can be mostly anything.
The JAF allows for building a wide range of applications, from those that are more oriented towards back office operations, like moderation tools, to applications that are all about community interaction and getting everyone to participate.
We are looking forward to seeing the most creative ways to expand JungleTV!

For an entry to qualify, it just has to be a functioning JAF application that abides by the usual JungleTV and JAF guidelines, and is submitted through the [usual process](manual/review_deployment.md#submitting-an-application) within the period of the contest (see below).
Make sure to include a Banano address in our submission so you may receive prizes!
The complete [competition rules](#competition-rules) apply.

This contest is heavily inspired by the traditional [Banano Booster contest](https://medium.com/banano/show-us-what-you-got-banano-booster-3-announcement-f019a22fae27), but has no affiliation with it or its organizers.

You can participate individually or as part of a group.
Each person or group can submit multiple entries, which may receive separate prizes!

## Timeline

The Boosted AF contest submission window
- begins on **April 19, 2024** at 00:00 UTC,
- and ends on **June 19, 2024** at the end of the day - 23:59 UTC.

Because there would be no way for us to enforce otherwise, you may begin working on your applications before April 19, and naturally, you may continue working on them past June 19.
However, **only submissions received within this period will be eligible for prizes**!
Updates submitted after the contest submission window will not be considered while judging.

Winners will be selected no later than two months after the end of the contest submission window - that is, by August 19, 2024.
(However, we definitely hope to be done well before then!)

## Prize pool

There is a total prize pool of at least **100000 Banano**.
The prize pool is stored on the following Banano account, which you can easily follow on Creeper:

[`ban_3boostedcoc7i68wjom11xriyrbo37rm6j7rjbwdimfqfi6gcbnfuf9gsqop`](https://creeper.banano.cc/account/ban_3boostedcoc7i68wjom11xriyrbo37rm6j7rjbwdimfqfi6gcbnfuf9gsqop)

### Donations

We encourage the donation of additional Banano to the prize pool address above!
The JungleTV team will **match up to 50K Banano in donations**.
This effectively means that, if the community donates a total of 50K Banano, then the prize pool will increase to 200K Banano!

More details on the specific prize distribution will be announced a few weeks into the contest, no later than May 10 - this page will be updated by then.
However, we can already tell you that the grand winner will receive _at least_ 25K Banano, and that we intend to generously reward at least **five** different projects.

## Winner selection criteria

More details will be revealed together with the details on prize distribution.
For now, we can say that it is very likely that submissions will be judged by members of the JungleTV team, as well as through the participation of the JungleTV community at large.
We may also invite additional judges from the Banano community.
The judging criteria will encompass technical prowess, visual polish, as well as the perceived creativity/utility/"fun factor."

## Competition rules

- Applications entering the contest must follow the [normal submission process](manual/review_deployment.md#submitting-an-application), additionally **including a Banano address in its submission message** (to receive prizes).
  - Projects and project versions submitted outside of the April 19 - June 19, 2024 period will not be eligible.
  - Projects that fail the [normal review process](manual/review_deployment.md#scope-of-the-review) and do not submit a passing update within the aforementioned period will not be eligible.
- Once an application passes the normal review process, the developer will be asked to [authorize its deployment](manual/review_deployment.md#deployment), which they must do to remain eligible for the contest.
  This is so that the submission can be tried out by the JungleTV community on the production version of the website.
  - Projects that withdraw their deployment authorization before the selection of the contest winners will be disqualified.
    This selection will happen no later than August 19, 2024.
- Regardless of their classification in the contest, the normal [rights and duties](manual/review_deployment.md#rights-and-duties) and [post-deployment rights and duties](manual/review_deployment.md#post-deployment-rights-and-duties) apply to contestants and their submissions.
  - Note that withdrawing the deployment permission before the winners are selected will result in a disqualification, as explained previously.
- Each person or group may submit multiple different applications for appreciation, which will be considered in the exact same way as if they had been submitted by different identities.
- Submitted applications will be scrutinized to ensure that the developers have the rights to use all of the intellectual property within their applications, including code, graphical assets and overall design elements.
  We reserve the right to disqualify any entries that are found to be fraudulent in this regard.
  - Note that projects are allowed to use third-party resources - these just need to be adequately licensed.
    The contest organizers may ask for proof of the permission to use such resources in cases where it may be less clear.
- Projects are eligible regardless of how they chose to license original code and other assets (i.e. projects do not need to be open source).
- Projects are eligible regardless of having been developed with the help of the [public staging environment](manual/environments_editors.md#the-staging-lab-environment) or by privately spinning up a JungleTV instance.
- Projects are eligible regardless of the technology stack they use, as long as they are compatible with the JungleTV Application Framework.
  On this front, the contest organizers reserve the right to disqualify projects that are incompatible with the JungleTV instance that is running on the aforementioned staging environment on June 19, 2024.
  - The contest organizers vouch not to change the JungleTV software running in said instance between June 10 and the conclusion of winner selection process.
- Contestants do not need to publicly reveal their identity at any point.
  However, regardless of their contest placement, the contest organizers reserve the right to not pay out prizes to sanctioned entities, entities known to be in jurisdictions where such contests are disallowed, and entities that are known to be in bad standing with: the JungleTV community, the Banano community at large, or other associated communities.
- Contestants will not be given the opportunity to appeal the contest results or the associated prize distribution.
- The contest organizers reserve the right to make minor changes to the rules throughout the contest submission period, in order to combat any major loopholes that they find to be against the spirit of the contest.

## Participate!

Developing for the JungleTV Application Framework should be easy for most people with basic JavaScript and web development experience.
To develop applications, you do not even need to install any software!
And applications are hosted by JungleTV itself.

> If you think you are not up to the task, consider teaming up with other people who have the necessary skills!
> Spread the word about Boosted AF, help contest participants and, who knows, maybe Banta Claus will make an off-season appearance!

To get started, just read the [introduction](/introduction/README.md), then proceed to the section on how to get started, and you'll get the basics of how to make JAF applications in no time.
If you decide to go forward with the development of one or more original applications, we **strongly** recommend that, over time, you read the rest of the [JAF manual](/manual/README.md)!
