# JungleTV Application Framework Docs

Welcome to the official documentation for the **JungleTV Application Framework**!
Known as JungleTV AF for short, or even simply as JAF, this framework enables the development and delivery of custom experiences within [JungleTV](https://jungletv.live), a media sharing and "watch/listen together" website.

If you are unfamiliar with JungleTV, we recommend first going through its [about page](https://jungletv.live/about); if you are not new to JungleTV but the Application Framework is news to you, we recommend going through the [Introduction](/introduction/).

You can navigate the documentation through the table of contents and the search function, both located on the sidebar, to the left.
On devices with narrow screens, you may have to press the â‰¡ icon on the top left to make the sidebar appear.

## Get in touch

JungleTV, the JungleTV Application Framework, and this documentation are all part of the same project. We can always use your feedback on how to improve the documentation and the framework itself.
Additionally, if you are interested in developing an application for JungleTV, you should get in touch with the JungleTV team to discuss the general viability of your concept prior to investing too many resources on it.

- Technical discussion about the JungleTV AF and the JungleTV core should happen on the channel dedicated to JungleTV on the [BananoLabs Discord server](https://discord.gg/YYdJ3Ztf3t).
  - This is the channel you should use to request help with the development of a JAF application, or ask questions about the JAF capabilities, for example.
- To communicate problems with the JAF documentation, use the [GitHub issues on the `jungletv-afdocs` repository](https://github.com/tnyim/jungletv-afdocs/issues).
  - This is the channel you should use if you e.g. find a typo or omission on this website.
- For technical issues/suggestions relative to the JAF and the core of JungleTV itself, use the [GitHub issues on the `jungletv` repository](https://github.com/tnyim/jungletv/issues).
  - This is the channel you should use if you believe you have found a bug on the Application Framework, or if you have a structured proposal for a yet-unsupported use case for the JAF. _It is probably a good idea to start a discussion on the BananoLabs channel first!_
- For general non-technical discussion about JungleTV and its community activities, you should use the channel dedicated to JungleTV on the [Banano Discord server](https://chat.banano.cc/).
  - This is the channel you should use to ask questions about upcoming community events, suggest events, communicate problems with payouts, report violations of community guidelines, communicate problems with already deployed JungleTV AF applications (unless otherwise indicated by the application developers), and so on.
