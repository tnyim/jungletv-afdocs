# JungleTV Application Framework Docs

Welcome to the official documentation for the **JungleTV Application Framework**!
Known as JungleTV AF for short, or even simply as JAF, it allows for the development and delivery of custom experiences within [JungleTV](https://jungletv.live), a media sharing and group media consumption website.
If you have never heard about JungleTV, we recommend first going through the [about page](https://jungletv.live/about); if it is otherwise your first time here, we recommend going through the [Introduction](/introduction/).

## Get involved

JungleTV, the JungleTV Application Framework, and this documentation are all part of the same open source project. We can always use your feedback on how to improve the documentation and the framework itself. **[[TODO] Mention feedback channels]**
