| `applicationID`    | string?               | Application ID responsible for this user, may be `undefined` if this user is not controlled by an application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `isFromAlienChain` | boolean               | Whether the `address` is from a currency system that is not the one native to JungleTV.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `nickname`         | string?               | Nickname of the user, may be `undefined` if the user does not have a nickname set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `permissionLevel`  | `"user"` or `"admin"` | Permission level of the user, may not be accurate in all contexts: may report a lower permission level than that which the user is able to achieve in a different context. Specifically, JungleTV staff may present an `"user"` value in some contexts, despite the same reward address appearing with an `"admin"` permission level in other contexts. Always perform permission checks against the most recent or otherwise relevant User object. |
