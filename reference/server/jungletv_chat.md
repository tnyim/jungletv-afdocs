# `jungletv:chat` module

The `jungletv:chat` module allows for interaction with the JungleTV chat subsystem.

This module is not imported by default. To use this module, import it in your server scripts as follows:

```js
const chat = require("jungletv:chat")
```

## Methods

### `addEventListener()`

Registers a function to be called whenever the specified [event](#events) occurs.
Depending on the event, the function may be invoked with arguments containing information about the event.
Refer to the documentation about each [event type](#events) for details.

#### Syntax

```js
chat.addEventListener(type, listener)
```

##### Parameters

- `type` - A case-sensitive string representing the [event type](#events) to listen for.
- `listener` - A function that will be called when an event of the specified type occurs.

##### Return value

None.

### `removeEventListener()`

Ceases calling a function previously registered with [`addEventListener()`](#addeventlistener) whenever the specified [event](#events) occurs.

#### Syntax

```js
chat.removeEventListener(type, listener)
```

##### Parameters

- `type` - A case-sensitive string corresponding to the [event type](#events) from which to unsubscribe.
- `listener` - The function previously passed to [`addEventListener()`](#addeventlistener), that should no longer be called whenever an event of the given `type` occurs.

##### Return value

None.

### `createMessage()`

Creates a new chat message, that is immediately sent to all connected chat clients and registered in the chat message history.
The message will appear as having been sent by the application, with the [nickname](#nickname) that is currently set.
Optionally, the message may reference another non-system message to which it is a reply.

#### Syntax

```js
chat.createMessage(content)
chat.createMessage(content, referenceID)
```

##### Parameters

- `content` - A string containing the content of the message.
  It must not be empty or consist of only whitespace characters.
  The content will be parsed as a restricted subset of [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) by the JungleTV clients.
  Consider escaping any characters that may unintentionally constitute Markdown formatting.
  Message contents are subject to some of the validation rules of chat messages sent by users, but do not have an explicit length limit.
- `referenceID` - An optional string containing the ID of another message to which this one is a reply.
  The message must not be a system message.
  This message reference may be removed from the message at a later point, if the referenced message is deleted.

##### Return value

A [message object](#message-object) representing the created chat message.

### `createMessageWithPageAttachment()`

Similar to [createMessage()](#createmessage), creates a new chat message including an application page as an attachment.
The message will appear as having been sent by the application, with the [nickname](#nickname) that is currently set.
The specified page must correspond to a page published by the caller application.
Optionally, the message may reference another non-system message to which it is a reply.

#### Syntax

```js
chat.createMessageWithPageAttachment(content, pageID, height)
chat.createMessageWithPageAttachment(content, pageID, height, referenceID)
```

##### Parameters

- `content` - A string containing the content of the message.
  Unlike with [createMessage()](#createmessage), **the content may be empty**.
  The content will be parsed as a restricted subset of [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) by the JungleTV clients.
  Consider escaping any characters that may unintentionally constitute Markdown formatting.
  Message contents are subject to some of the validation rules of chat messages sent by users, but do not have an explicit length limit.
- `pageID` - The ID of the application page to attach, as specified when publishing the page using e.g. [publishFile()](jungletv_pages#publishfile).
  The attached application page will be displayed below the content.
- `height` - The non-zero height of the application page in pixels as it will be displayed in the chat history.
  The maximum height is 512 pixels.
- `referenceID` - An optional string containing the ID of another message to which this one is a reply.
  The message must not be a system message.
  This message reference may be removed from the message at a later point, if the referenced message is deleted.

##### Return value

A [message object](#message-object) representing the created chat message.

### `createSystemMessage()`

Creates a new chat message with the appearance of a system message (centered content within a rectangle, without an identified author), that is immediately sent to all connected chat clients and registered in the chat message history.

#### Syntax

```js
chat.createSystemMessage(content)
```

##### Parameters

- `content` - A string containing the content of the message.
  The content will be parsed as [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) by the JungleTV clients.
  Consider escaping any characters that may unintentionally constitute Markdown formatting.
  System message contents do not have an explicit length limit.

##### Return value

A [message object](#message-object) representing the created chat message.

### `getMessages()`

Retrieves chat messages created between two dates.

#### Syntax

```js
chat.getMessages(since, until)
```

##### Parameters

- `since` - A Date representing the start of the time range for which to retrieve chat messages.
- `until` - A Date representing the end of the time range for which to retrieve chat messages.

##### Return value

A promise that will resolve to an array of [message objects](#message-object) sent in the specified time range.
Shadowbanned messages are not included.

### `removeMessage()`

Deletes a chat message.

#### Syntax

```js
chat.removeMessage(messageID)
```

##### Parameters

- `messageID` - A string containing the ID of the message to delete.

##### Return value

A [message object](#message-object) representing the deleted chat message.

## Properties

### `enabled`

This writable property indicates whether the chat is enabled.
When the chat is disabled, users are not able to send messages.
Users may still be able to see recent chat history up to the point when the chat was disabled.
System messages can still be created (e.g. using [`createSystemMessage()`](#createsystemmessage)) and may be visible to users subscribed to the chat, but this behavior is not guaranteed.
When the chat is disabled, applications are still able to fetch chat message history using [`getMessages()`](#getmessages).

#### Syntax

```js
chat.enabled = true
chat.enabled = false
```

### `slowMode`

This writable property indicates whether the chat is in slow mode.
When the chat is in slow mode, most users are limited to sending one message every 20 seconds.
Slow mode does not affect chat moderators nor the creation of system messages.

#### Syntax

```js
chat.slowMode = true
chat.slowMode = false
```

### `nickname`

This writable property corresponds to the nickname set for this application, visible in chat messages sent by the application.
When set to `null`, `undefined` or the empty string, the application will appear in chat using its ID.
The nickname is subject to similar restrictions as nicknames set by users.

#### Syntax

```js
chat.nickname = "My application"
chat.nickname = null
```
