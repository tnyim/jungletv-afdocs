# `jungletv:points` module

The `jungletv:points` module allows for interaction with the JungleTV points subsystem.

This module is not imported by default. To use this module, import it in your server scripts as follows:

```js
const points = require("jungletv:points")
```

## Methods

### `addEventListener()`

Registers a function to be called whenever the specified [event](#events) occurs.
Depending on the event, the function may be invoked with arguments containing information about the event.
Refer to the documentation about each [event type](#events) for details.

#### Syntax

```js
points.addEventListener(type, listener)
```

##### Parameters

- `type` - A case-sensitive string representing the [event type](#events) to listen for.
- `listener` - A function that will be called when an event of the specified type occurs.

##### Return value

None.

### `removeEventListener()`

Ceases calling a function previously registered with [`addEventListener()`](#addeventlistener) whenever the specified [event](#events) occurs.

#### Syntax

```js
points.removeEventListener(type, listener)
```

##### Parameters

- `type` - A case-sensitive string corresponding to the [event type](#events) from which to unsubscribe.
- `listener` - The function previously passed to [`addEventListener()`](#addeventlistener), that should no longer be called whenever an event of the given `type` occurs.

##### Return value

None.

### `createTransaction()`

Adjusts a user's point balance by creating a new points transaction.

#### Syntax
```js
points.createTransaction(address, description, points)
```

#### Parameters
- `address` - Reward address of the account to add/remove points from.
- `description` - The user-visible description for the transaction.
  Must not be an empty string.
- `points` - A non-zero integer corresponding to the amount to adjust the balance by.

##### Return value

The created [points transaction](#transaction-object).

##### Exceptions

- `TypeError` - Thrown if the user has insufficient points to cover this transaction, when `points` is negative.

### `getBalance()`

Returns the current points balance of a user.

#### Syntax
```js
points.getBalance(address)
```

#### Parameters
- `address` - The reward address of the account for which to get the balance.

##### Return value

A non-negative integer representing the available points balance of the user.

### `getNiceSubscription()`

Returns a user's current subscription to JungleTV Nice.

#### Syntax
```js
points.getNiceSubscription(address)
```

#### Parameters
- `address` - The reward address of the account for which to get the subscription.

##### Return value

The currently active JungleTV Nice [subscription](#subscription-object) for the specified user, or null if the user is not currently subscribed to JungleTV Nice.

## Events

### `transactioncreated`

This event is fired when a completely new points transaction is created.

#### Syntax
```js
points.addEventListener("transactioncreated", (event) => {})
```

#### Event properties

| Field         | Type                               | Description                            |

| `transaction` | [Transaction](#transaction-object) | The created points transaction.        |

### `transactionupdated`

This event is fired when an existing points transaction has its value updated.
This can only happen for specific transaction types, for which consecutive transactions of the same type are essentially collapsed as a single transaction.
The updated transaction retains its creation date but its update date and its value changes.

#### Syntax
```js
points.addEventListener("transactionupdated", (transaction) => {})
```

#### Event properties
