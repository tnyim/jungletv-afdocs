# JungleTV AF Reference

The reference section documents every aspect of the different APIs available to JungleTV AF applications, both on the server and on the client.
The reference is a "drier" section focused on exaustive listing of smaller details about individual parts of those APIs.
To get the big picture on how to combine these APIs to achieve a functioning JAF application, you should instead go though the [Getting started](/getting-started/) section and the [Manual](/manual/).


- The [Server modules](./server/README.md) section contains a reference for all the APIs available to code running on the server.
- The [App bridge](./appbridge/README.md) section contains a reference for the client-side API and UI elements, that are provided by the helper script that should be included in application pages.
