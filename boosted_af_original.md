Boosted AF is a software development contest where everyone is invited to build projects for the JungleTV Application Framework!
Organized by the JungleTV team, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to compete with others at developing applications for the JungleTV AF, while being handsomely rewarded.

**Don't miss out on a prize pool of 100K [Banano](https://banano.cc) and counting!**

> If you've never heard of it, [JungleTV](https://jungletv.live) is a media sharing website for the Banano community, where people gather to consume videos and music together, while spending and receiving Banano.
>
> The JungleTV Application Framework (also known as JungleTV AF or JAF) is a way for anyone to extend the functionality of the service in a relatively simple way, without having to change the JungleTV source code.
In order to make JungleTV AF applications, you don't even have to install any software other than the browser you are already using!
For more information, check out the [introduction](./introduction/README.md) section of this manual.

Boosted AF has no categories or a specific theme - all submissions compete with each other, and applications can be mostly anything.
The JAF allows for building a wide range of applications, from those that are more oriented towards back office operations, like moderation tools, to applications that are all about community interaction and getting everyone to participate.
We are looking forward to seeing the most creative ways to expand JungleTV!

For an entry to qualify, it just has to be a functioning JAF application that abides by the usual JungleTV and JAF guidelines, and is submitted through the [usual process](manual/review_deployment.md#submitting-an-application) within the period of the contest (see below).
Make sure to include a Banano address in our submission so you may receive prizes!
The complete [competition rules](#competition-rules) apply.

This contest is heavily inspired by the traditional [Banano Booster contest](https://medium.com/banano/show-us-what-you-got-banano-booster-3-announcement-f019a22fae27), but has no affiliation with it or its organizers.

You can participate individually or as part of a group.
Each person or group can submit multiple entries, which may receive separate prizes!

## Timeline

The Boosted AF contest submission window
- begins on **April 19, 2024** at 00:00 UTC,
- and ends on **June 19, 2024** at the end of the day - 23:59 UTC.

Because there would be no way for us to enforce otherwise, you may begin working on your applications before April 19, and naturally, you may continue working on them past June 19.
However, **only submissions received within this period will be eligible for prizes**!
Updates submitted after the contest submission window will not be considered while judging.

Winners will be selected no later than two months after the end of the contest submission window - that is, by August 19, 2024.
(However, we definitely hope to be done well before then!)

## Prize pool

There is a total prize pool of at least **100000 Banano**.
The prize pool is stored on the following Banano account, which you can easily follow on Creeper:

[`ban_3boostedcoc7i68wjom11xriyrbo37rm6j7rjbwdimfqfi6gcbnfuf9gsqop`](https://creeper.banano.cc/account/ban_3boostedcoc7i68wjom11xriyrbo37rm6j7rjbwdimfqfi6gcbnfuf9gsqop)

### Donations

We encourage the donation of additional Banano to the prize pool address above!
The JungleTV team will **match up to 50K Banano in donations**.
This effectively means that, if the community donates a total of 50K Banano, then the prize pool will increase to 200K Banano!

### Winner prizes

- 1st place: 30% of the prize pool
- 2nd place: 25% of the prize pool
- 3rd place: 20% of the prize pool
- 4th place: 15% of the prize pool
- 5th place: 10% of the prize pool

There may be yet to be disclosed bonus prizes waiting for exceptional entries and also for valiant efforts that don't make it to the top 5!

## Winner selection criteria

Judging will primarily be performed by three members of the JungleTV community:
- The JungleTV lead developer, who is not eligible to participate in the contest;
- Two other community members, who will remain unannounced at least until the disclosure of the results.
  These will not have participated in the contest either, and are vetted to ensure they are not partial towards any specific entry or contestant.

As a reminder, applications which do not pass the normal application review process will most likely not even get to this judging phase.

Judging will take into account the following criteria:
- **Technical prowess (40% of the score)**: this criteria focuses on whether the submitted application works as described and uses the JAF in accordance with the documentation.
  Applications that are ambitious in the scope of their features, and manage to live up to that - successfully implementing all they've set out to do - will do well in this criteria.
  Applications whose code is well-organized and easy to understand will over equivalent applications that do not present such cleanliness, as far as this criteria is concerned.
  Similarly, for those applications which publish their own pages, those that have pages that work well across different devices, input methods and screen sizes will be rewarded over those that present restrictions in this regard.
  Submissions which are excessively simple (for example, barely going beyond the examples shown in this documentation) or which have a clear lack of "attention to detail" on the technical implementation front, may be penalized.
  Those which present serious bugs, are shown to be missing necessary security checks, explicitly go against the JAF usage guidelines set throughout its documentation, or which have major performance issues, will be greatly penalized on the technical prowess front.
- **Creativity and utility (30% of the score)**: this criteria is about the idea and intention behind each submission.
  It values applications which manifest novel ideas on how to extend JungleTV, how to combine the JungleTV AF capabilities, or which make life easier for JungleTV users or staff.
  Generally, we want to see applications which allow something to be done that couldn't be done otherwise, or which would be less convenient or less entertaining without the help of the submitted application.
  Submissions which do not really bring anything new to the table, or which are overly unexciting, will be penalized in this criteria.
- **User-facing polish (30% of the score)**: this criteria focuses on how "professional" and "well finished" an application looks to the intended end users.
  It recognizes submissions with an appropriate user interface design, as well as text and/or pictures and/or other built-in media that look carefully put together, fit in to JungleTV and which are consistent within the application.
  Applications which have "prototype looks," needlessly complicated or bug-ridden user interfaces, artistic elements which look like they've been pulled together from five different clipart collections, etc. will be penalized as far as this criteria goes.

To help with judging the last two criteria, the judges may turn to the JungleTV community, hosting the submitted applications in the production environment and asking for user feedback, for example, through the use of polls or by questioning random users directly.
However, due to the potential for abuse, it is unlikely that any part of the judging process will be left entirely up to the community.
Pure community-based voting would also be unfair to those submissions whose intended direct users are the JungleTV staff, such as moderation and event management tools.

For each criteria, those judging that criteria will be asked to attribute a score, within a fixed scale that will be the same for each contest entry.
Those scores will then be added together, and divided by the number of people judging that criteria, to form each submission's score for that criteria.
The scores within each criteria will then be added in a weighted fashion, in accordance with the percentages shown, to form each submission's final score.
The submission that achieves the highest score will win 1st place in the competition, the second highest will win 2nd place, and so on.

## Competition rules

- Applications entering the contest must follow the [normal submission process](manual/review_deployment.md#submitting-an-application), additionally **including a Banano address in its submission message** (to receive prizes).
  - Projects and project versions submitted outside of the April 19 - June 19, 2024 period will not be eligible.
  - Projects that fail the [normal review process](manual/review_deployment.md#scope-of-the-review) and do not submit a passing update within the aforementioned period will not be eligible.
- Once an application passes the normal review process, the developer will be asked to [authorize its deployment](manual/review_deployment.md#deployment), which they must do to remain eligible for the contest.
  This is so that the submission can be tried out by the JungleTV community on the production version of the website.
  - Projects that withdraw their deployment authorization before the selection of the contest winners will be disqualified.
    This selection will happen no later than August 19, 2024.
- Regardless of their classification in the contest, the normal [rights and duties](manual/review_deployment.md#rights-and-duties) and [post-deployment rights and duties](manual/review_deployment.md#post-deployment-rights-and-duties) apply to contestants and their submissions.
  - Note that withdrawing the deployment permission before the winners are selected will result in a disqualification, as explained previously.
- Each person or group may submit multiple different applications for appreciation, which will be considered in the exact same way as if they had been submitted by different identities.
- Submitted applications will be scrutinized to ensure that the developers have the rights to use all of the intellectual property within their applications, including code, graphical assets and overall design elements.
  We reserve the right to disqualify any entries that are found to be fraudulent in this regard.
  - Note that projects are allowed to use third-party resources - these just need to be adequately licensed.
    The contest organizers may ask for proof of the permission to use such resources in cases where it may be less clear.
- Projects are eligible regardless of how they chose to license original code and other assets (i.e. projects do not need to be open source).
- Projects are eligible regardless of having been developed with the help of the [public staging environment](manual/environments_editors.md#the-staging-lab-environment) or by privately spinning up a JungleTV instance.
- Projects are eligible regardless of the technology stack they use, as long as they are compatible with the JungleTV Application Framework.
  On this front, the contest organizers reserve the right to disqualify projects that are incompatible with the JungleTV instance that is running on the aforementioned staging environment on June 19, 2024.
  - The contest organizers vouch not to change the JungleTV software running in said instance between June 10 and the conclusion of winner selection process.
- Contestants do not need to publicly reveal their identity at any point.
  However, regardless of their contest placement, the contest organizers reserve the right to not pay out prizes to sanctioned entities, entities known to be in jurisdictions where such contests are disallowed, and entities that are known to be in bad standing with: the JungleTV community, the Banano community at large, or other associated communities.
- Contestants will not be given the opportunity to appeal the contest results or the associated prize distribution.
- The contest organizers reserve the right to make minor changes to the rules throughout the contest submission period, in order to combat any major loopholes that they find to be against the spirit of the contest.

## Participate!

Developing for the JungleTV Application Framework should be easy for most people with basic JavaScript and web development experience.
To develop applications, you do not even need to install any software!
And applications are hosted by JungleTV itself.

> If you think you are not up to the task, consider teaming up with other people who have the necessary skills!
> Spread the word about Boosted AF, help contest participants and, who knows, maybe Banta Claus will make an off-season appearance!

To get started, just read the [introduction](/introduction/README.md), then proceed to the section on how to get started, and you'll get the basics of how to make JAF applications in no time.
If you decide to go forward with the development of one or more original applications, we **strongly** recommend that, over time, you read the rest of the [JAF manual](/manual/README.md)!
